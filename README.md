# Surfalot CMS for osCommerce 2.3.4 Official Release

Surfalot CMS is an osCommerce App designed to help the developer and shop owner alike build, maintain, and organize content easily 
in one place. TinyMCE is integrated to provide WYSIWYG content editing.

Create new content and insert it into your navigation quickly and easily directly in the admin. Edit content on existing pages by 
placing a small template code snippet on your target page. The responsive features of osCommerce v2.3.4 Community Edition are 
maintained throughout the App.

Full osCommerce built-in cache support is available. If your shop runs with osCommerce cache, Surfalot CMS will cache all the page 
queries so your shop maintains peak performance. Dynamic content from the additional shortcode module is still injected at display 
time.
